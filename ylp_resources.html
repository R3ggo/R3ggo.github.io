                <p style="margin-left: 6vw;margin-right: 6vw;">
                    I'm making this site to provide resources for freshmen who are new
                    to making a YLP, because these resources aren't provided to you in
                    your classes for some god forsaken reason. Some of the presentations
                    I saw this year were honestly pretty good and were well put together.
                    They could have been better though. I have a ton of issues with the 
                    way that YLP's are run and graded but I don't have a choice in those
                    matters, however; I can still help with the YLP's you have to make even if 
                    I think a different system would be better. 
                </p>

                <h1>The Good Stuff</h1>

                <h2>
                    GitHub
                </h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 6vw;margin-right: 6vw;">
                    To some of you pointing out GitHub as a resource seems silly, because
                    if you have any real applicable coding knowledge, of course you would
                    use GitHub. Despite it being one of the most vital tools in any real
                    world coding project, they don't tell you about it in your classes. It
                    stores all your work in the cloud and allows you to collaborate with 
                    your partners on code. Please for the love of god, use GitHub. There
                    have been so many people who have lost projects a week before
                    presentations and been absolutely and unequivocally screwed.

                </p>

                <h2>
                    VSCode
                </h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 5.7vw;margin-right: 5.7vw;">
                    Along the same vein as GitHub, this is something that you're going to 
                    use on nearly every project in the field of computer science. VSCode
                    is a free code editor that allows you to debug and run code projects.
                    It's absolutely necessary for making almost any code related project. 
                    One thing I recommend is finding VSCode plugins that work for you and 
                    help you develop your code better. Some people like using VSCode 
                    liveshare which allows you to edit in VSCode with another person at
                    the same time, similiar to google docs. I never personally liked liveshare
                    because me and my partner usually don't work on the same code at the 
                    same time, but it could be something that helps you.

                </p>

                <h2>
                    Slidesgo
                </h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 5.7vw;margin-right: 5.7vw;">
                    This is quite possibly the most important thing that freshmen need 
                    to use. It makes your slides look so much better than they would with
                    a default google slides theme. Please for the love of god use Slidesgo,
                    or at least some other type of slide template so that your slides look 
                    nice. The theme you choose doesn't even necessarily have to do a
                    whole lot with your YLP. It also helps to use the slides that are meant
                    to be used for like 2-4 points and a label on them. Also make sure you
                    use the icons that are usually at the bottom of their templates. 
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Godot
                </h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 5.7vw;margin-right: 5.7vw;">
                    This is less of a necessity than the other resources but if you plan 
                    on making a game you should definitely use godot. There are so many 
                    videos and tutorials for godot it's insane. GDscript is also extremely
                    similar to python which, assuming the curriculum doesn't change, is 
                    what freshmen learn.

                <h1>General Advice</h1>

                <h2>
                    Don't use scratch
                </h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 5.7vw;margin-right: 5.7vw;">
                    Please don't use Scratch. Of any way to make a YLP, Scratch is the 
                    most disappointing. I would rather see a YLP in the Roblox engine
                    than even hear the notion of a YLP in scratch. The point of a YLP 
                    should be to demonstrate real coding knowledge and ability. Using 
                    Scratch only demonstrates your ability to embarass yourself by 
                    pretending your Scratch game is worth my time.

                    This is something that I think a lot of people don't realize can 
                    help so much with their YLP. Coming in you have no references and 
                    usually very little real experience coding.
