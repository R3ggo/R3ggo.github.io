                    Hello, my name is Reagan. I'm a student (scholar) at Ignite and I think there's something horrible happening 
                    in the school. My dear friend Jean Jacques has gone missing and I'm the only one who seems to have noticed. Any 
                    time I try to ask anybody about him they always say that I'm crazy and avoid the question.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will continue to investigate this. I know Jean Jacques is out there. I know something is happening. 
                    I will find out what happened to my buddy if it's the last thing I do.
                </p>
